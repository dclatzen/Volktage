Volktage Project README
by Devon Latzen

This project is in progress.

Volktage is in the business of building custom computers.
They want users to completely customize and order products through their site.
Users may select every component, down to the number of fans on the case.

The code deposited here is a mock order storage and retrieval system,
stored on my localhost. 
It allows users to play around, create orders, and view them without having to sign in.
If they sign in, users may also store, retrieve, modify, and (eventually) purchase orders.

Next steps:
Remove bug checking scripts, suppress error reporting.
Move to subdirectory on live server, integrate with true databases.
Incorporate functionality into UI.
Integrate cart API (most likely paypal).
